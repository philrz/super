# Developer

SuperDB includes some basic
[libraries](libraries/intro.md) for interacting with a database,
and some initial
[integrations](integrations/intro.md) with external systems.

>[!NOTE]
> The SuperDB project team has been focusing on the stability of the
> SuperSQL language and SQL compatibility for the past 18 months.
> A Rust port is forthcoming and the developer APIs will become more
> performant and stable as that port lands.
