## Expressions

Expressions are the means the carry out calculations and utilize familiar
query-language elements like literal values, function calls, subqueries,
and so forth.

Within [pipe operators](../operators/intro.md),
expressions may reference [input values](inputs.md) either via the special value
`this` or implied field references to `this`, while
within [SQL clauses](../sql/intro.md), input is referenced with table and
column references.

For example, [`values`](../operators/values.md), [`where`](../operators/where.md),
[`cut`](../operators/cut.md), [`put`](../operators/put.md),
[`sort`](../operators/sort.md) and so forth all utilize various expressions
as part of their semantics.

Likewise, the projected columns of a
[`SELECT`](../sql/select.md) from the very same expression syntax
used by pipe operators.

While SQL expressions and pipe expressions share an identical syntax,
their semantics diverges in some key ways:
* SQL expressions that reference `this` have [semantics](../sql/intro.md#accessing-this)
  that depend on the SQL clause that expression appears in,
* relational tables and/or columns cannot be referenced using aliases in pipe scoping,
* double-quoted string literals may be used in pipe expressions but are interpreted
  as identifiers in SQL expressions.

### Expression Syntax

Expressions are composed from operands and operators over operands.

Operands include
  * [inputs](inputs.md),
  * [literals](literals.md),
  * [formatted strings](f-strings.md)
  * [function calls](functions.md),
  * [subqueries](subqueries.md), or
  * other expressions.

Operators include
  * [arithmetic](./arithmetic.md) to add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc,
  * [cast](cast.md) to convert values from one type to another,
  * [comparisons](comparisons.md) to compare two values resulting in a Boolean,
  * [concatenation](concat.md) of strings,
  * [conditionals](conditional.md) including C-style `?-:` operator and SQL `CASE` expressions,
  * [containment](containment.md) to test for the existing value inside an array or set,
  * [dot](dot.md) to access a field of a record (or a SQL column of a table),
  * [exists](exists.md) for SQL compatibility to test for non-empty subqueries,
  * [indexing](index.md) to select and slice elements from
      an array, record, map, string, or bytes,
  * [logic](logic.md) to combine predicates using Boolean logic, and
  * [slices](slices.md) to extract subsequences from arrays, sets, strings, and bytes.
  
### Identifier Resolution

An identifier that appears as an operand in an expression is resolved to
the entity that it represents using lexical scoping.

For identifiers that appear in the context of call syntax, i.e., having the form
```
<func> ( <args> )
```
then `<func>` is one of:
* the name of a [built-in function](../functions/intro.md),
* the name of a [declared function](../declarations/functions.md),
* a [lambda expression](functions.md#lambda-expressions), or
* a function parameter that resolves to a
[function reference](functions.md#function-references) or
[lambda expression](functions.md#lambda-expressions).

Identifiers that correspond to an in-scope function may also be referenced
with the syntax
```
& <name>
```
as a [function reference](functions.md#function-references)
and must appear as an argument to an operator or function; otherwise, such
expressions are errors.

For identifiers that resolve to in-scope declarations, the resolution is
as follows:
* [constants](../declarations/constants.md) resolve to their defined constant values,
* [types](../declarations/types.md) resolve to their named type,
* [queries](../declarations/queries.md) resolve to an implied subquery invocation, and
* [functions](../declarations/functions.md) and [operators](../declarations/operators.md)
  produce an error.

For other instances of identifiers,
then identifier is presumed to be an [input reference](inputs.md)
and is resolved as such.

### Precedence

When multiple operators appear in an unparenthesized sequence,
ambiguity may arise by the order of evaluation as expressions are
not always evaluated in a strict left-to-right order.  Precedence rules
determine the operator order when such ambiguity exists where higher
precedence operators are evaluated before lower precedence operators.

For example,
```
1 + 2 * 3
```
is `7` not `9` because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
and the above expression is equivalent to \
```
1 + ( 2 * 3 )
```
Operators have the following precedence from highest to lowest:

* `[]` [indexing](index.md)
* `-`, `+` [unary sign](arithmetic.md#unary-sign)
* `||` [string concatenation](concat.md)
* `*`, `/`, `%` [multiplication, division, modulo](arithmetic.md)
* `-`, `+` [subtraction, addition](arithmetic.md)
* `=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `<>`, `!=`, `is` [comparisons](comparisons.md)
* `not`, `!` [logical NOT](logic.md), `exists` [existence](exists.md)
* `like`, `in`, `between` [comparisons](comparisons.md)
* `and` [logical AND](logic.md)
* `or` [logical OR](logic.md)
* `?:` [ternary conditional](conditional.md#ternary-conditional)

Some operators like [case expressions](conditional.md#case-expressions)
do not have any such ambiguity as keywords delineate their sub-expressions
and thus do not have any inherent precedence.

### Coercion

>[!NOTE]
> A forthcoming version of this documentation will describe the coercion
rules for automatically casting of values for type compatibility in expressions.
