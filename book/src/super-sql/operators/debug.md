# debug

[✅](../intro.md#data-order)&ensp; tap a pipeline to emit debugging values

## Synopsis

```
debug [ <expr> ] [ filter ( <pred> ) ]
```

## Description

The `debug` operator passes its input unmodified to its output and for
each value in the input, evaluates the optional
[expression](../expressions/intro.md) `<expr>`,
and transmits each result to a _debugging output_.
If `<expr>` is omitted, then each input value is passed unmodified to the
debugging output.

An optional filter may be applied to the values sent to the debugging output,
which is specified with Boolean-valued expression `<pred>`.
In this case, `<pred>` is applied to each input value of the debug operator
and only the values for which `<pred>` is true are emitted as `<expr>`
to the debugging output.

When running a query with the [super](../../command/super.md) command,
the debugging output is printed to standard error.
In this case, debugging output is displayed in the [SUP](../../formats/sup.md) format
independent of the `-f` flag.

When running a query in a database service, the debugging output is transmitted
to the client on the output channel named "debug".  If the client in this case
is the [super db](../../command/super.md) command,
then the debugging output is printed to standard error.

>[!NOTE]
> A future version of SuperDB Desktop will support viewing debug output
> in a panel in the application.

## Examples

---

_Hello, world_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
values "hello, world" | debug {debug:this} | where false
# input

# expected output
{debug:"hello, world"}
```

---

_Apply a filter to debug trace_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
values {x:1,y:2},{x:3,y:4} | debug y filter (x=1) | where false
# input

# expected output
2
```
