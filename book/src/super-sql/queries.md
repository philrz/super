## Queries

The syntactical structure of a query consists of
* an optional concatenation of [declarations](declarations/intro.md),
  followed by
* a sequence of [pipe operators](operators/intro.md)
  separated by a pipe symbol (`|` or `|>`).

Any valid SQL query may appear as a pipe operator and thus
be embedded in a pipe query.  A SQL query expressed as a pipe operator is
called a [SQL operator](sql/intro.md).

Operator sequences may be parenthesized and nested to form lexical [scopes](#scope).

Operators utilize expressions in composable variations to
perform their computations and all expressions
share a common [expression syntax](expressions/intro.md).
While operators consume a sequence of values, the expressions embedded
within an operator are typically evaluated once for each value processed
by the operator.

### Scope

A scope is formed by enclosing a set of [declarations](declarations/intro.md)
along with an operator sequence in the parentheses having the structure:
```
(
    <declarations>
    <operators>
)
```
Scope blocks may appear
* anywhere a [pipe operator](operators/intro.md) may appear,
* as a [subquery](expressions/subqueries.md) in an expression, or
* as the body of a [declared operator](declarations/operators.md).

The parenthesized block forms a
[lexical scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope).
Bindings created by declarations within the scope are reachable within that
scope and any scopes nested within it.

A declaration cannot redefine an [identifier](#identifiers) that was previously defined in the same
scope but can override identifiers defined in ancestor scopes.

The topmost scope is the global scope where all declared identifiers
are available everywhere and does not include parentheses.

Note that this lexical scope refers only to the declared identifiers.  Scoping
of references to data input is defined by
[pipe scoping](intro.md#pipe-scoping) and
[relational scoping](intro.md#relational-scoping).

For example, this query containing a constant declaration emits the value `3.14`
```mdtest-spq {data-layout='no-labels'} {style='margin:auto;width:85%'}
# spq
const PI=3.14
values PI
# input

# expected output
3.14
```
whereas the following query fails because the second reference to `PI` is not
in the scope of the declared constant and thus the identifier is interpreted
as a field reference `this.PI` via pipe scoping.

```mdtest-spq fails {data-layout='no-labels'} {style='margin:auto;width:85%'}
# spq
( 
  const PI=3.14
  values PI
)
| values this+PI
# input

# expected output
"PI" no such field at line 5, column 15:
| values this+PI
              ~~
```

### Identifiers

Identifiers are names that arise in many syntactical structures and
may be any sequence of UTF-8 characters.  When not quoted,
an identifier may be comprised of Unicode letters, `$`, `_`,
and digits `[0-9]`, but may not start with a digit.

To express an identifier that does not meet the requirements of an
unquoted identifier, arbitrary text may be quoted inside of backtick (`` ` ``)
quotes.
Escape sequences in backtick-quoted identifiers are interpreted as in
[string literals](types/string.md).  In particular, a backtick (`` ` ``)
character may be included in a backtick string with Unicode escape `\u0060`.

In SQL expressions, identifiers may also be enclosed in double-quoted strings.

The [special value](intro.md#pipe-scoping) `this` is also available in SQL but has
[peculiar semantics](sql/intro.md#accessing-this)
due to SQL scoping rules.  To reference a column called `this`
in a SQL expression, simply use double quotes, i.e., `"this"`.

An unquoted identifier cannot be `true`, `false`, `null`, `NaN`, or `Inf`.

### Patterns

For ease of use, several operators utilize a syntax for string entities
outside of expression syntax where quotation marks for such entities
may be conveniently elided.

For example, when sourcing data from a file on the file system, the file
path can be expressed as a [text entity](#text-entity) and need not be quoted:
```
from file.json | ...
```

Likewise, in the [search](operators/search.md) operator, the syntax for a
[regular expression](#regular-expression) search can be specified as
```
search /\w+(foo|bar)/
```
whereas an explicit function call like [regexp](functions/parsing/regexp.md) must be invoked to utilize
regular expressions in expressions as in
```
where len(regexp(r'\w+(foo|bar)', this)) > 0
```

#### Regular Expression

Regular expressions follow the syntax and semantics of the
[RE2 regular expression library](https://github.com/google/re2),
which is documented in the
[RE2 Wiki](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

When used in an expression, e.g., as a parameter to a function, the
RE2 text is simply passed as a string, e.g.,
```
regexp('foo|bar', this)
```

To avoid having to add escaping that would otherwise be necessary to
represent a regular expression as a [raw string](types/string.md#raw-string),
prefix with `r`, e.g.,
```
regexp(r'\w+(foo|bar)', this)
```

But when used outside of expressions where an explicit indication of
a regular expression is required (e.g., in a
[search](operators/search.md) or
[from](operators/from.md#database-operation) operator), the RE2 is instead
prefixed and suffixed with a `/`, e.g.,
```
/foo|bar/
```
matches the string `"foo"` or `"bar"`.

#### Glob

Globs provide a convenient short-hand for regular expressions and follow
the familiar pattern of "file globbing" supported by Unix shells.
Globs are a simple, special case that utilize only the `*` wildcard.

Like regular expressions, globs may be used in
a [search](operators/search.md) or [from](operators/from.md) operator.

Valid glob characters include letters, digits (excepting the leading character),
any valid string escape sequence
(along with escapes for `*`, `=`, `+`, `-`), and the unescaped characters:
```
_ . : / % # @ ~ *
```
A glob cannot begin with a digit.

#### Text Entity

A text entity represents a string where quotes can be omitted for
certain common use cases regarding URLs and file paths.

Text entities are syntactically valid as targets of a
[from](operators/from.md) operator and as named arguments
to the `from` and [load](operators/load.md) operators.

Specifically, a text entity is one of:
* a [string literal](types/string.md) (double quoted, single quoted, or raw string),
* an unquoted string consisting of a sequence of characters consisting of letters, digits, `_`,  `$`,  `.`, and `/`, or
* a simple URL consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with `http://` or `https://`,  followed by dotted strings of letters, digits, `-`, and `_`, and in turn optionally followed by `/` and a sequence of characters consisting of letters, digits, `_`, `$`, `.`, and `/`.

If a URL does not meet the constraints of the simple URL rule,
e.g., containing a `:` or `&`, then it must be quoted.

### Comments

Single-line comments are SQL style begin with two dashes `--` and end at the
subsequent newline.

Multi-line comments are C style and begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.

```mdtest-spq {data-layout='no-labels'} {style='margin:auto;width:85%'}
# spq
values 1, 2 -- , 3
/*
| aggregate sum(this)
*/
| aggregate sum(this / 2.0)
# input

# expected output
1.5
```
